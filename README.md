### Purpose :dog:
red ball is an online community that encourages adoption and fostering from a interactive social aspect. Similar to product reviews by users on Amazon, volunteers that have interacted with available dogs can leave ratings so that potential adopters can gain a better gauge of the dog's personality.


### Quickstart :floppy_disk:

1.  `bundle install`
2.  `rake db:create`
3.  `rake db:migrate`
4.  `rake db:seed`
5.  `shotgun`


### About the Project :page_with_curl:
red ball was my final project for Phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp and presented on March 13, 2015.

### In Progress - April 18, 2015 :open_file_folder:
1. **Run on Rails -** Currently red ball is running on Sinatra + PostgresSQL.
2. **Responsive Design -** For a Phase 3 final group project, I was able to learn how to make websites responsive, in particular using Bootstrap's grid system.
3. **Testing -** Due to the time restraint, I focused on delivering the project on time, thus I didn't test anything. I'd like to practice testing in Cabybara.
4. **Search function-** Implement pg_search, fuzzy search, or some way where user can easily find a breed without having to type out the exact breed name in the database.


### Rocket Challenges :rocket:
1. Use SASS.
2. Use Angular.
3. Use Petfinder API so that people can search for dogs throughout participating animal shelters in the US. Currently I am using data that I scraped from Family Dog Rescue organization in San Francisco.
4. Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Create an extra page and code it with TDD.
